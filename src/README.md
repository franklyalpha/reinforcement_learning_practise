For implementations of CS285, UCLA's public deep reinforcement learning courses. 
https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/

There are 4 algorithms you need to implement at least:
Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic, Q-Learning, and Model-Based Algorithm. 

Need to follow self-studying lecture notes (currently finished lecture 10) linked below: 
https://github.com/franklyalpha/studying_notes/tree/main/Public_Courses

Besides need to frequently go through PyTorch's official website and your self-studying notes on PyTorch, linked below: 
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html
